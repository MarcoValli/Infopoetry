            <h2>The Hardest Climb</h2>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Where are the hardest sport climbing route?  When it comes to overcome human limits, only a few people can develop the techniques and the athletic shape to do it, but what happens when this impressive skills meet the limits imposed by nature?<br> In sport climbing the limit is imposed by the impervious characteristics of the rock, but lately some superhumans started to climb what a few years ago seemed impossible. It's interesting to notice how the most the most difficult climbing routes are hosted just by a <b>small number of countries</b> even though the 25% of the earth is covered by mountains.<br> The vertical axis in the visualization below starts from 9a+|5.15a, two equivalent ways to describe the difficulty of a climbing route. When it comes to this level of complexity it's hard to truly define the difficulty of the ascension so a climbing route can variate its <em>grade</em> slightly based on the judgement of the climber. <br><br>To be clearer let's just say that from the start of the Y axis it's probable that you need to use <b>just one finger to hold on a crimp</b> while climbing. </p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>Adam Ondra, a professional rock climber and currently one of the best climbers in the world, made a little piece of climbing history when he climbed his project in the spectacular Hanshelleren Cave in Norway. The route, later named Silence, received a new grade of 9c and became the hardest route in the world.</p>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Pefecto Mundo - Spain, Margalef - Stefano Ghisolfi 2019 ↓</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
    <div  width="50%">
  <p>‘Perfecto Mundo’ in Catalonia is officially one of the hardest climbs in the world. At grade 9b+, the route is so difficult that sections only allow room to fit a single finger. That, and you need acrobat-like abilities just to contort your body around its unforgiving edges.
To rank that highly, Italian climber Stefano Ghisolfi says it has to have a certain level of difficulty – a level that is just nudging ‘impossible’. “It is determined by the steepness of the overhanging wall, the grip holes, their dimensions and the distance they are from each other,” says Ghisolfi. “Some holes on Perfecto Mundo are really small.”</p>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Fight Club - Canmore, Canada - Alex Megos 2016 ↓</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Two weeks later, Alex sent it, completing what was most likely the hardest single pitch of climbing in Canada and possibly North America at the time this catalog printed. What does it mean for Canada to have its first 5.15? Nothing, really. It’s just a number. The challenge itself—the wall, the rock—has been there all along. Teamwork and friendship brought it to life this summer. Some might think of this as a passing of the torch, but climbing is a community of people with a common passion. Whether you’re climbing on the cutting edge doesn’t matter at all in the end.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>When you climb a route at your maximum level you need to want it more than anything else in the world. But at the same time, this desire can keep you from succeeding. So you need to find the balance, let everything go, just climb for the pure joy of climbing, let things flow and try as hard as possible while not being concerned about the outcome.</p>
